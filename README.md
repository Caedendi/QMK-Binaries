# QMK-Binaries
QMK + VIA Firmware that is supported by SignalRGB (includes protocol information for direct ARGB mode).
	
**This may include different "playground" QMK releases..**
* 0.14.29 is Keychron's bluetooth_playground so at least when charging a K2 Pro to K8 Pro the ARGB is controllable. (Bluetooth is not supported by SignalRGB currently) - This also includes q1 version two firmware now as well.
* 0.15.12-sonix is for Sonix based keyboards _only_.
* 0.19.11 is the old [QMK Mainline github](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
* 0.19.12 is the new [QMK Mainline github](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

**PLEASE NOTE On Febuary 25th, 2023: I will be pausing all updates as Breaking Changes for QMK occur the next day, after reviewing new code binary firmware updates will start back up.**
