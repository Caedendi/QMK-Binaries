# QMK-Binaries
QMK + VIA Firmware that is supported by SignalRGB (includes protocol information for direct ARGB mode).
	
This may include different "playground" QMK releases..
		0.14.29 is Keychron's bluetooth_playground so at least when charging a K2 to K8 Pro the ARGB is controllable.
	

See https://discord.gg/J5dwtcNhqC for support.

If you notice something missing (keyboard or variation of a keyboard) or have any issues with these binaries please contact Naitoshedo on the above Discord server.
