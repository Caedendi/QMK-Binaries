QMK + VIA Firmware that is supported by SignalRGB (includes protocol information for direct ARGB mode).
	
**This may include different "playground" QMK releases..**
* 0.14.29 is Keychron's bluetooth_playground so at least when charging a K2 to K8 Pro the ARGB is controllable. (Bluetooth is not supported by SignalRGB currently)
* 0.19.11 is the [QMK Mainline github](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
